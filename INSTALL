Installation Instructions for Pcapstats
=======================================

Pcapstats uses the well-known configure(autotools) infrastructure.

    $ ./configure
    $ make
    $ make install

Prerequisites
=============

    * libpcap (tcpdump.org)
 
    * libpacket (bitbucket.org)

Configuring and compiling
=========================

./configure [options]

--prefix=

    The   prefix  to   put   all   installed  files   under.   It  defaults   to
    /usr/local,  so the  binaries  will go  into  /usr/local/bin, manpages  into
    /usr/local/share/man, etc.

--enable-debug (or --disable-debug)

    Enable or disable debugging options, this is strictly for development usage.

--enable-builtin

    This option causes pcapstats to be  compiled with custom versions of certain
    system functions.  Note that they  will be used when  they don't exist  on a
    host system.

Experimental or Unsafe
======================

--enable-pthreads

    Enable threading support,  this feature is untested and  not recommended for
    use.

    - This is deamed unsafe because it  will spawn a new thread for each timeout
      queue created.

    - This will be re-evaluated in the future.
